# B.R.O.G.

A personal blog based on [码志](mzlogin/mzlogin.github.io). BROG is short for "Bromine's Refuge, Oasis and Garage". 

<!--Actually, the name of my blog can be simply divided into two parts, Br and Blog, which means the blog of Br, short of BromineBr, very easy to catch on.-->

I will put some comments about games, anime, and something I like, also something useful for me, in my blog. But It's not so "personal" . Anyway, welcome to my B.R.O.G. .
